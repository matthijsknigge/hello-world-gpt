# Hello World GPT Command-Line Bridge

This repository contains an experimental tool that acts as an intermediary between a local command-line and ChatGPT. The tool listens to commands generated by ChatGPT, runs those commands in a secure shell on your desktop, captures the output, and returns the result back to ChatGPT for further processing.

## Overview

1. **intermediate_tool.py**: A Python script that connects to the OpenAI API, receives messages, extracts the command to run, executes it in the terminal, and sends the output back to ChatGPT.
2. **prompt_instructions.md**: A set of guidelines that define how ChatGPT should format its responses so that the intermediary tool can parse and execute commands safely.

## Usage

1. Obtain an OpenAI API key and set it in your environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
2. Run `python intermediate_tool.py` to start the loop. The script will send system instructions and user messages to ChatGPT and will execute commands that are enclosed in `<command>` tags.
3. Review `prompt_instructions.md` for the exact prompt you should use to instruct ChatGPT to behave correctly.

This is an experimental prototype; always use caution when allowing automated systems to run shell commands. Commands that modify or delete files should be avoided or require explicit confirmation.
